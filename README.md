## Supply Chain Analysis
The supply chain dataset comprises 24 columns and 100+ rows, containing information on various aspects of the supply chain, including product details, pricing, availability, sales, manufacturing, shipping, and costs. It is designed for analyzing revenue generation, manufacturing expenses, and transportation costs to optimize supply chain operations.

## Problem Statement
The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, manufacturing, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

### Mysql Analysis:-
I used MySQL to analyze supply chain data and answer specific questions.

📊 Total Revenue by Product Type: Calculate the total revenue generated by each product type. This can help identify the most profitable products.

🚚 Shipping Costs by Carrier: Calculate the average shipping costs for each shipping carrier to evaluate which carrier is the most cost-effective.

⏳ Lead Times by Supplier: Calculate average lead times for each supplier to assess their reliability in delivering products on time.

🌍 Total Products Sold by Location: Determine the total number of products sold in each location to understand regional demand.

🔍 Defect Rates by Inspection Results: Calculate defect rates for different inspection results to assess product quality.

💰 Ranking Products by Profitability: Write a query to rank products based on profitability, where profitability is calculated as (revenue generated - manufacturing costs - shipping costs).

🏆 Top  Shipping Carriers by each Product type: Determine the top shipping carriers with the lowest average shipping costs per product type.

📦 Supplier Performance Analysis: Calculate the average lead time for each supplier and identify suppliers with lead times higher than the overall average.

### Power BI:-
Power BI - Dashboard

In Powe Bi, build charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize the data and understand it more interactively, along with that, build some slicers to make it more user-friendly to customize the charts and graphs.

Build some cards to understand some key performance indicators, including:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1️⃣ Total Revenue: 2.3M

2️⃣ Average Product Price: 49.46

3️⃣ Total Products Sold: 46.1K

4️⃣ Avg. Manufacturing Cost: 24.25

5️⃣ Total Available Products: 4,612

6️⃣ Total Stock Value: 4,777

## Insights

The highest number of products sold among the three product categories is skincare, which accounts for 45% of the business. Haircare follows at 29%, and cosmetics contribute 25% to the revenue.

Analyzing customer demographics versus the number of products sold by product type reveals that the female group purchases higher-quality skincare and cosmetic products, while the male group opts for products of roughly equal quality in terms of haircare and cosmetics.

An unknown group category purchases a higher quantity of haircare products. Skincare products are the most popular among all four product categories, indicating a high demand.

Analyzing product availability and stock levels shows that the company maintains an equal quantity of inventory for haircare and skincare products, with slightly less stock for cosmetics. Skincare products exhibit higher availability and lower stock levels, enabling quick manufacturing and shipment.

In contrast, cosmetics and haircare have higher stock levels and lower availability, meaning the company faces challenges in promptly shipping these products due to longer manufacturing times.

Haircare products exhibit longer lead times and higher production volumes, possibly due to the need for more specialized ingredients or manufacturing processes.

skincare products show a higher defect rate.

An analysis of revenue generated by shipping carriers indicates that shipping carrier C is costlier but shipping carrier B generates higher revenue.

According to the graph, the fastest and most efficient shipping option is Carrier B, and the most efficient transportation mode is road in all four transportation modes.
